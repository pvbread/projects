This is a basic text-based interpretation of the game Towers of Hanoi. Although it can be made simply with lists instead of stacks, I utilize stacks here to practice the form.

The rules of the game are as follows:

Pick a starting number of disks (3 is recommended to start).
The objective is to move all the disks
from the left stack to the right stack.
|1|	
|2|	
|3|	
|4|    |GOAL|
 L   M   R
When you pick a stack, you move its topmost disk.
You can choose any stack to move the disk to,
they don't have to be sequential...
The number of the disk indicates the disk size --
you cannot stack a disk that is larger than another on top.
