This is a python script that processes DNA strings through restriction enzymes.
It will automatically produce output files for each restriction enzyme that affects the DNA.

I've provided two test files in the folder.

Improvements to be made: Fasta file format compatibility and testing.

Usage: ./enzyme_sim.py restriction_enzyme_file dna_file
