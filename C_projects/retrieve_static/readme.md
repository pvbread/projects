<h3>Retrieve static</h3>

This is a simple program that plays with the idea of retrieving a static value that is set <i>inside the scope</i> of a function.

The aim of this is to gain familiarity with pointers and static variables.
The next step is to have it retrieve a counter in a loop in the same fashion.
